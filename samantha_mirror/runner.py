"""Start the server: bind to the Tailscale address, log, and serve.

It is meant to run unattended from logon to logoff, so it keeps itself working:
  - at boot Tailscale can know its address before Windows has attached it to the network
    adapter (WinError 10049): keep retrying instead of giving up;
  - if the listener ever stops answering (Tailscale restarted or updated, adapter reset),
    a watchdog tears it down and builds a fresh one.
